953,2021-09-27T18:36:37.041Z,,700,Can you explain to me how you got that answer?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,2021-09-27T18:37:03.348Z,,709,"Well when I read the word ""rate"" I knew that we were using proportional relationships&nbsp;",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,2021-09-27T18:37:51.826Z,,700,I realized while you were typing that I forgot to ask you what the word rate means.&nbsp; Thank you for clarifying that for me.&nbsp; Can you describe the steps you took to get the answer?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,2021-09-27T18:38:54.808Z,,709,"So when I realized that we have to use proportional relationships, I knew that since Omar picks 8 ounces in 3 minutes and 8 goes into 96 12 times all I needed to do was multiply the minutes by 12 too",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,2021-09-27T18:39:32.419Z,,700,"Now does your answer make sense?&nbsp; If so, why?&nbsp; If not, why not?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,2021-09-27T18:40:17.829Z,,709,Yeah. It makes sense because we just know that to get from 8 to 96 we multiply by 12 and so we just need to multiple the 3 minute intervals by this value too to get the total time&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,2021-09-27T18:40:30.569Z,,700,"Are there other ways that you could have solved the problem?&nbsp; If there are, what are some other methods?",Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,1,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,2021-09-27T18:41:11.562Z,,709,"Yeah there are other ways. Since we are using proportional relationships, we could also find the unit rate to solve it&nbsp;",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,2021-09-27T18:41:42.942Z,,700,That is correct!&nbsp; Now do you believe that your method was the most efficient way to solve that part of the problem?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,1,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

955,2021-09-27T18:34:34.407Z,,713,i mean i see it&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:34:43.822Z,,704,"Hi, Braden. Can you tell me how you solved part 1 of the problem?",Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,"should questions like this count as you focused? have in past, but now I'm thinking no technically... ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:36:29.485Z,,713,"so I know that 96 is 12 times 8 and since you multiply 8 by 12 to get 96, we also need to multiply 3 times 12 to get 36 minutes&nbsp;",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:37:05.517Z,,704,What made you think to multiply 12 by 8?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:37:32.030Z,,713,Well i know 96 is 12 times 8 from the 12 times table,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:38:08.368Z,,704,What parts of the word problem made you think of the numbers 12 and 8?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:39:45.709Z,,713,So Omar is picking 8 ounces of strawberries in 3 minutes so that's where the 8 comes from. Then we want to know how long it takes him to pick 96 ounces so I knew if we multiplied 8 by 12 it gave us 96.&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:40:40.863Z,,704,"Okay, and how did you know to multiply 12 by 3 afterward?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:41:29.243Z,,704,"Excuse me, I meant multiply 3 by 12.",Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:41:30.751Z,,713,when I see the word rate in a problem I know it's a proportion so we need to multiply 3 by the same number we multiplied 8 by,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:41:59.160Z,,713,Since we did 8 * 12 we also have to do 3 * 12 I thought,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:42:19.477Z,,704,"Okay, so you solved a proportion to solve the problem. How did you solve part 2?",Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,R,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:43:25.086Z,,713,"when maeve helps omar, it means the number of people picking strawberries doubles which means that the amount of time it will take to pick 96 ounces of strawberries will be cut in half, so instead of taking 36 minutes, it will take 18 minutesâ€‹",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:43:50.008Z,,713,i did division to check that 36 divided by 2 is 18,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,2021-09-27T18:44:04.023Z,,704,Okay. Do you think that this problem-solving strategy will always be an efficient way to solve the problem?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,1,1,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

898,2021-09-16T17:51:52.158Z,,800,"thats fantastic, what happened when maeve started picking strawberries? how long did it take then?",Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:52:16.206Z,,801,"When maeve began to help, the rate at which they picked strawberries doubles&nbsp;",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:52:27.880Z,,801,so instead of 8/3 it is 16/3&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:52:33.949Z,,800,great thinking,Teacher,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:52:39.693Z,,800,what was the time it took then,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:53:02.418Z,,801,"It would take half the time it took Omar to pick them alone, so 16 minutes",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:53:30.517Z,,800,"hm thats interesting, you say that it would take half the time, but what is half of 36?",Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:53:59.586Z,,801,"tough day, 18 minutes!&nbsp;",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:54:22.076Z,,800,ahhhh i see! so when maeve and omar worked together it takes 18 minues.,Teacher,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:54:48.138Z,,800,"what would happen if we added a third person, say samantha to help pick",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:54:51.967Z,,800,how long would it take then,Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,continuation of prior line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:56:17.989Z,,801,"Assuming she picks at the same rate, they together would pick strawberries at a rate 3x Omar alone, so 8/3 *3= 8. 96 divided by 8 is 12 so it would take 12 minutes",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
898,2021-09-16T17:56:25.517Z,,800,perfect!,Teacher,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:35:47.791Z,,806,Hello,Student,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:35:53.011Z,,807,well hello there,Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:39:54.603Z,,807,Hi Emilie! How did you approach the first part of this problem?,Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:40:06.618Z,,806,I started with making a table.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:40:31.571Z,,807,Okay could you explain what that table looks like? What values did you use?&nbsp;,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:41:37.367Z,,806,I made my table by making different columns for minutes and strawberries picked.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:41:57.877Z,,807,How did the table help you solve part 1 of the problem?&nbsp;,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:42:34.742Z,,806,Having the column for time helped me answer the first part about the time for Omar to pick 96 ounces.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:42:56.675Z,,807,Do you think this strategy would always work?&nbsp;,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,1,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:43:03.338Z,,806,Yes.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:43:30.862Z,,807,Did you use this strategy in part 2 or use another method to solve the problem?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,1,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:43:41.435Z,,806,I used the same strategy.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:44:20.918Z,,807,Could you tell me how you used the table for part 1 compared to part 2? How was it similar and how was it different?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,1,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:44:41.722Z,,806,I just added a column for Maeve for the second part.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:45:20.931Z,,807,So what was your answer using the table in part 1 and part 2?&nbsp;,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
908,2021-09-19T17:45:51.370Z,,806,My answers were 36 minutes and 18 minutes.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T17:56:52.195Z,,806,Hello.,Student,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T17:56:55.272Z,,807,hi there,Student,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T17:59:29.987Z,,806,How did you start part 1?,Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T17:59:54.986Z,,807,Well when I saw the word rate in the problem I knew it was a proportion.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:00:02.798Z,,807,So I set up a proportion for part 1,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:00:12.131Z,,806,How did you set up the proportion?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:00:40.456Z,,807,It was 8 ounces in 3 minutes and then it was asking for the time for 96 ounces.&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:01:04.036Z,,807,So I knew that 96 is 8 times 12,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:01:30.299Z,,806,Okay. Did you use this same reasoning for the second part of the problem?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,1,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:01:40.730Z,,807,yes,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:02:07.057Z,,806,How did you use this reasoning with two different people picking the strawberries?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:02:21.954Z,,807,Adding another strawberry picker will always double the amount of strawberries picked.&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:03:04.313Z,,806,Is this true if Maeve picked 8 strawberries in 4 minutes?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:03:11.993Z,,807,no,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:03:35.775Z,,806,So what in the problem told you that it would double to rate of strawberries picked?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:04:08.570Z,,807,It said they would pick twice the amount of strawberries in the same amount of time,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:04:36.380Z,,806,Did the problem say that in those words?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:04:42.393Z,,807,yes,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:05:21.534Z,,806,"From what I see in the problem, it said that Maeve picks at the same rate as Omar, not that it doubles. So how did you find that they doubled?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,2021-09-19T18:06:05.885Z,,807,If they pick at the same rate then you have two people picking 8 ounces in the same 3 minutes. This is double the ounces because there are two people,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:13:23.993Z,,804,Hello,Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:13:30.645Z,,805,hello,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:17:15.775Z,,804,Emilie what are your thoughts about part 1?,Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:17:44.747Z,,805,I think it went well,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:18:27.309Z,,804,Did you find how many minutes it would take Omar to pick 96 ounces of strawberries?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:18:43.342Z,,805,"Yes, 36 minutes",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:19:01.649Z,,804,Good! Can you tell me how you figured this out?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:19:30.468Z,,805,I organized the information into a table to see how the strawberry picking added up,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:21:20.891Z,,804,I like that you organized it into a table to visually see it. Do you see any patterns from your table?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,1,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:21:56.987Z,,805,Every 3 minutes he picked 8 more strawberries,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:22:23.235Z,,805,ounces *,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:22:56.069Z,,804,Yes! Do you see a possible ratio?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,1,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:23:18.492Z,,805,3 to 8?,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:23:51.445Z,,804,Why 3 to 8 and not 8 to 3?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:24:24.022Z,,805,for every 3 minutes he picks 8 more ounces,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:25:45.967Z,,804,Okay! So does this change how you would do part 2?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:26:20.259Z,,805,No,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:26:56.870Z,,804,That is okay! So using your table how did you find your answer to part 2?,Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,evaluating?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:27:41.816Z,,805,I added a column for Maeve to help me see what adding a second person would do for the amount of strawberries picked,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:28:18.595Z,,804,How did Maeve change the outcome?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:28:52.105Z,,805,They were able to pick the strawberries faster,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:28:59.753Z,,804,How much faster?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:29:31.570Z,,805,18 minutes faster,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:31:25.434Z,,804,Great! SO together they picked strawberries 2 times faster. Why do you think using a table was a good option rather than an equation?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,1,S,,funneling because student never mentions 2x faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
917,2021-09-19T22:32:29.197Z,,805,So I could see the pattern,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,2021-09-19T22:44:36.118Z,,805,Hello,Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,2021-09-19T22:44:40.183Z,,804,hello,Student,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,2021-09-19T22:46:40.426Z,,805,What answer did you get for part 1?,Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,2021-09-19T22:46:47.493Z,,804,36 minutes,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,2021-09-19T22:47:00.795Z,,805,How did you get that answer?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,2021-09-19T22:48:31.766Z,,804,I saw the word rate and I knew that Omar picks 8 ounces in 3 minutes. I know 12 times 8 is 96 and 12 times 3 is 36.&nbsp;&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,2021-09-19T22:50:48.008Z,,805,Good! So what did you get for part 2?,Teacher,,1,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,2021-09-19T22:51:07.686Z,,805,Good! So what did you get for part 2?,Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,repeat line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:20:02.804Z,,815,"So, Emilie, tell me about how you solved this problem.",Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:20:37.759Z,,808,I made a table,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:20:42.649Z,,815,Tell me more about that.,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:21:07.774Z,,808,I made columns for Omar strawberries and had it aligned with minutes so I could count my berriews,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:21:36.520Z,,815,Tell me what is in your columns. How many berries did you get in all?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:22:04.345Z,,815,"Oops, I meant to ask how many minutes!",Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:22:40.943Z,,808,"So I knew we had 8 berries every 3 minutes, So i counted by 8 for berries and 3 for minutes until my berries summed to 86",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:22:47.702Z,,808,96,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:23:15.445Z,,808,for part 2 I added in meave. Part 1 did not include meave&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:23:27.330Z,,815,Great! What changed when you added Maeve?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:23:42.173Z,,808,we had 2 people picking instead of 1,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:24:01.742Z,,815,How did that change how fast they got to 96 ounces of berries?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:24:20.312Z,,808,they could pick more in less time,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:24:39.191Z,,815,Interesting. How much time did it take for them to get to 96 ounces together?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,does this count as evaluating?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:24:56.739Z,,808,18 minutes&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:25:11.227Z,,815,"OK, how is that related to how fast Omar was able to pick berries on his own?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,does this count as evaluating?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:25:40.917Z,,808,omar picked 96 oz in 36 minutes. So they picked 2x as fast&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:26:00.586Z,,815,"Why do you think it's 2 times as fast, and not some other number?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:26:35.783Z,,808,since it took omar 36 minutes and with meave it took 18. 18+18=36,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:26:58.069Z,,815,Do you think it had anything to do with how fast Maeve picked berries compared to Omar?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,1,1,1,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
929,2021-09-20T20:27:23.083Z,,808,I just copied how fast omar picked into a new column for meave,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

930,2021-09-20T20:40:05.350Z,,815,I made a table.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:40:15.795Z,,808,Could you explain your table to me?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,general press for reasoning?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:40:28.985Z,,815,"Well, I had a column for minutes and a column for ounces of berries.",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:40:55.474Z,,808,What was your thought process when making those colums,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:41:34.876Z,,815,"I knew that Omar could pick 8 ounces of berries every 3 minutes, so I kept writing 3 and 8 and 3 and 8 until I got to the number of ounces.",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:42:27.332Z,,808,I see. How did you adjust for part 2?&nbsp;,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:42:58.725Z,,815,For every 3 minutes I added 8 more ounces.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:43:09.549Z,,808,Why did you choose to do that,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:43:33.493Z,,815,Because Maeve picks strawberries at the same rate as Omar.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:43:54.966Z,,808,So you added the same amount of berries again for Meave?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,,1,1,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:43:58.425Z,,815,Yes,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:44:17.140Z,,808,Do you think this strategy would work if I asked how fast the two can pick 800 oz?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,1,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:44:30.201Z,,815,Sure. It would just take awhile.,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:44:51.600Z,,808,Do you think there is a way that would be quicker?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,1,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:44:56.636Z,,815,Maybe?,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,2021-09-20T20:45:53.682Z,,808,Do you think we could use multiplication in this scenario?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,1,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

id02,1:24 PM,,802,What information did you put in the table?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id02,1:25 PM,,803,I made a column for the ounces Omar picked,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id02,1:25 PM,,802,Is that the only column you made? Or is there more information to add to the table?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id02,1:25 PM,,803,NO,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id02,1:26 PM,,802,So did you not have any more columns? Just the one for ounces?,Teacher,,,,,,,,,,1,,,R,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id02,1:26 PM,,803,I had more columns,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id02,1:26 PM,,802,What were they?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id02,1:27 PM,,803,I had a column for time,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id02,1:28 PM,,802,Okay good! What can we find out about how long it will take to pick 96 ounces of strawberries using this table of ounces and time?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,,,S,RP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1195,2021-10-18T14:25:47.903Z,,504,the foam cup is better,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:25:57.187Z,,501,What makes you think that?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:26:04.465Z,,504,it keeps the cold air out,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:26:13.286Z,,504,better than the paper cup,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:26:39.983Z,,501,How does the cold air stay out?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,1,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:27:13.680Z,,504,the walls for the foam cup are thicker so it keeps the hot chocolate warm,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:28:07.432Z,,501,"That is a good point, but with what you were saying before, how does the cold air stay out of the cup if we did not have a lid on it?",Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:28:41.332Z,,504,umm i dont know maybe through the walls?,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:29:19.907Z,,501,So you think that cold air is going through the walls?,Teacher,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,R,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:29:43.146Z,,504,yes because the paper cup is thinner it gets colder faster!,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:30:51.652Z,,501,"And from our data, how do we know it gets colder faster?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:31:12.036Z,,504,The paper cup was about 4 degrees cooler than the foam cup,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:31:17.851Z,,504,which isn't that much&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1195,2021-10-18T14:31:29.018Z,,504,is there really enough to say theres a difference?,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1197,2021-10-18T14:55:40.579Z,,501,the paper cup was at 42.6 degrees and foam was 46.5 degrees after&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:56:15.813Z,,504,So our initial temp was 76.7 what do you think happened with the heat after 30 mins,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:56:50.430Z,,501,the heat bounced off the walls of the cup,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:57:12.431Z,,504,Can you describe to me what that looks like?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:58:13.111Z,,501,well the heat is flowing through something,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:58:16.920Z,,504,"Awesome thinking!! When you think of heat, is it a solid, a liquid, or a gas?",Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,1,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:58:34.736Z,,501,i know its not a liquid,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:58:39.200Z,,501,but not a gas either,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:58:43.746Z,,501,something in between,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:58:50.902Z,,504,Is it possible for heat to be many things?,Teacher,,,1,,,,1,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:59:01.618Z,,504,Why can't heat be a liquid or gas?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:59:26.372Z,,501,well I know the liquid is the hot chocolate,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1197,2021-10-18T14:59:35.515Z,,501,so heat can't be thay,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:06:09.376Z,,501,"From our data and what we observed, what cup was the best at keeping the hot chocolate warm?",Teacher,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1202,2021-10-18T15:06:27.741Z,,501,And why do you say that?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:06:35.738Z,,504,uhh something with the walls maybe,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:07:05.877Z,,501,What about the walls makes you think the foam is better,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,RP,specific or general?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:07:36.104Z,,504,the cold air goes through the walls and since the foam cup has more walls the hot chocolate is hotter than the paper cup,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:08:33.858Z,,501,What is happening with the heat of the hot chocolate?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:08:51.131Z,,504,staying in the cup and waiting for cold air to make it cold&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1202,2021-10-18T15:09:41.253Z,,501,"If the heat is staying in the cup, then why is the temperature changing?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,RP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:09:54.411Z,,504,THE AIR IS COMING THROUGH THE WALLS,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:10:01.058Z,,504,how many times do I have to say that,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:11:19.402Z,,501,"If cold air is coming through the walls, where does the heat that the hot chocolate had at the beginning go?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:11:38.455Z,,504,outside the cup,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:11:44.815Z,,504,like swapies,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1202,2021-10-18T15:12:23.547Z,,501,So you think the heat is escaping somehow and the cold is coming in?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,S,RP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:41:08.717Z,,502,Hi,Student,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:41:08.911Z,,500,HI,Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:41:13.333Z,,500,Lol all caps,Teacher,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:44:16.539Z,,500,"So, Rosa, let's start by answering: which of the cups did a better job of answering the question?",Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:44:47.243Z,,502,I think the foam cup did a better job at answering our question,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:45:01.174Z,,500,"Okay, why do you say that?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:45:33.615Z,,502,"Because, after 30 minutes, the Foam cup had a higher temperature than the paper cup",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:46:21.540Z,,500,Great! So how do you think the foam cup was better able to keep the liquid hot than the paper cup?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:47:31.128Z,,502,"I think the foam cup did a better job because the material is thicker and foam is a better insulator than paper so, the particle movement slower down... slower in the foam cup than in the paper cup",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:48:23.831Z,,500,"Yes, that's a really interesting point Rosa. Can you elaborate on what you mean by insulator?",Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:49:15.313Z,,502,"Something that does a better job at retaining heat would be an insulator. So, a good example would be foam!&nbsp;",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1257,2021-10-22T00:50:01.810Z,,500,"Yes, I liked how you used our data as an example. You also mentioned particle movement slowing down. Could you tell me a little more about what you meant by that?",Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:00:57.053Z,,502,"Hi Victor, What do we think about our question?&nbsp;",Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:01:15.981Z,,500,I think the foam cup worked better,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:01:47.554Z,,502,"Okay, can you elaborate? What pointed you towards that conclusion?&nbsp;",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:02:15.749Z,,500,I saw that the temperature of the hot chocolate in the paper cup was less than the foam cup,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:02:47.158Z,,502,"Right, we noticed the difference in temperatures between the two cups, why do you think that is?&nbsp;",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,1,,G,RP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:03:16.121Z,,500,I think that's because the foam cup is better at keeping the cold air out of the hot chocolate,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:04:06.782Z,,502,Tell me more. What about the foam cup would make it better at keeping the cold air out?,Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,G,RP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:05:11.314Z,,500,I think that's because the cold air is able to come through the walls of the paper cup more than the foam cup,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:06:24.402Z,,502,"""keeping the cold air out""&nbsp; and ""cold air able to come through"" can you elaborate? What about our different materials points you to this conclusion&nbsp;â€‹",Teacher,,,1,,,,,1,,1,,S,RP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:07:03.198Z,,500,I think that the walls of the paper cup are thinner so more cold air can come in and make the hot chocolate colder,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1258,2021-10-22T01:07:36.297Z,,502,"I see. So, what makes a material good for keeping heat",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:14:47.539Z,,500,"So, Rosa, which cup did a better job of keeping the hot chocolate hot?",Teacher,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:14:54.763Z,,502,The Foam,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:15:15.184Z,,500,"Okay, what evidence made you say that?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,1,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:15:32.251Z,,502,After 30 minutes the temperature was higher in the foam than in the paper&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:15:45.968Z,,500,That's correct. Why do you think that was?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,,G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:16:08.060Z,,502,the heat inside the cup stays in the cup because it bounces off more&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:16:27.122Z,,500,"Okay, what bounces off more?",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:17:09.037Z,,502,the heat inside the cup bounces off the walls more. in the foam it does it more than in the paper thats why its hotter in the foam after 30 minutes,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:18:17.668Z,,500,That's an interesting conclusion. What do you think makes the heat bounce off more in the foam than the paper?,Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:18:52.840Z,,502,I think the foam is better at retaining heat than the paper.&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1259,2021-10-22T01:19:41.935Z,,502,I think foam is way thicker than paper&nbsp;,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1259,2021-10-22T01:20:52.788Z,,500,"I would agree. Earlier, you mentioned that heat was bouncing off the walls better in the foam than in the paper. Do you think heat is leaving the hot chocolate, or the cold air is coming in?",Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,1,,S,RP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1632,2021-12-07T16:31:07.233Z,,12470,I think matter stays the same when water freezes or paper is crumbled up because it is still the same amount f stuff just in a new shape,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1632,2021-12-07T16:34:10.242Z,,12470,since the weight stayed the same,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1632,2021-12-07T16:34:51.410Z,,12483,"Yes! Because the weight stayed the same, we can conclude that the mass stayed the same (the amount of stuff). Even though they changed shaped, the amount of stuff is the same",Teacher,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1659,2021-12-07T16:50:59.753Z,,12559,Ok good! What about the volume?&nbsp;,Teacher,,,1,1,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1659,2021-12-07T16:51:33.750Z,,13101,"I actually didn't think about that, so paper is paper.",Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1659,2021-12-07T16:52:19.399Z,,12559,"Ok, so when we crumpled the paper did it take up more or less space?&nbsp;",Teacher,,,1,,,,,,,,,S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1659,2021-12-07T16:53:16.255Z,,13101,It took up less space,Student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
